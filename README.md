Smart-Bots
==========

AI for a group of Critters. These Critters live in a world with both good food and bad food,
but at the beginning they do not know of the existence of either. As they eat good food,
they try to find more of it, and as they eat bad food they try to avoid it. Critters who have
eaten more good food have a higher chance of reproducing, and eventually all that is left is a
population of Critters who skillfully hunt good food and avoid bad food. This is managed through
the use of genetic algorithms.
